- 👋 Hi, I chose @what-aboot because I came here to suggest a feature (for rethink firewall). I've been a developer for nearly 40 years in a virtually unknown technology called multivalue or Pick. That said, it was sold under various names, like jBase, (used in over 5000 banks worldwide as part of T24, including JP Morgan, HSBC, even Barclays). Another vendor, IBM, selling a product called UniVerse, marketed to insurance, healthcare, and numerous vertical applications. I've worked in Africa, Australia, USA and UK and now call Scotland my home. I'd be happy to help anyone with Pick/multivalue issues :)

- 👀 I’m interested in avoiding ad trackers and invasive mobile advertising. Don't get me started on go ogle analytics or cross website tracking! I'm currently moving from Blokada to Rethink.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, have Anaconda on my laptop (Windows 10) but can't get Miniconda to install on a Win 7 Pro box. Why can't Microsoft make stuff that simply works?

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I wish. I'd be happy to test, but my coding style is called legacy for a reason.
